# Solving ODEs with Legendre Wavelets and Genetic Algorithms

Welcome to the project repository where we tackle the solution of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) using two innovative methods: **Legendre Wavelets** and **Genetic Algorithms**. This project aims to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of these two approaches in solving ODEs.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- **Implementation of Legendre Wavelets**: A mathematical technique leveraging orthogonal polynomials for solving ODEs.
- **Genetic Algorithm Approach**: An evolutionary algorithm inspired by natural selection used to find approximate solutions to ODEs.
- **Comparison Analysis**: A detailed comparison of the results obtained from both methods in terms of accuracy, convergence, and computational efficiency.

## Key Features

- ðŸ“ˆ **Legendre Wavelets Method**: Utilizes the properties of Legendre polynomials to transform and solve ODEs.
- ðŸ§¬ **Genetic Algorithm**: Applies crossover, mutation, and selection operations to evolve solutions over generations.
- ðŸ“Š **Result Comparison**: Visual and statistical comparison of the solutions obtained from both methods.
